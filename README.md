This program provides an implementation of a neural network model for joint extraction of named entities and their semantic relations,  as described in [my paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11275):

### Installation

jointRE requires the following software packages:

* `Python 2.7`
* [`DyNet` v2.0](http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html)

      $ virtualenv -p python2.7 .DyNet
      $ source .DyNet/bin/activate
      $ pip install cython numpy
      $ pip install dynet==2.0.3

Once you installed the prerequisite packages above, you can clone or download (and then unzip) jointRE.

### Usage

[jNERE](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/jointRE/tree/master/jNERE) and [jECRE](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/jointRE/tree/master/jECRE) correspond to two evaluation setup scenarios  NER&RC and EC&RC used in my paper, respectively.  Checkout `run.sh` in `scripts` folder. It should be self-explanatory.
